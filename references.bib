	abstract = {The deployment of Blockchain technology in the tourism industry is already becoming a reality with the gradual emergence of innovative business models. At its core is the promise of improving the efﬁciency of the tourism service value chain and enhancing the quality of the service provided to the end customer. This paper analyses research trends focused on using Blockchain technology in tourism. The aim is to determine how this technology impacts the tourism sector and its sustainability. A systematic review, descriptive bibliometric analysis, and network analysis based on co-authorship, co-citation, and keyword analysis criteria, among others, have been used. The results reveal that the subject matter analysed is generating a growing trend in academic research in the ﬁelds of sustainable management and supply chain efﬁciency. The activities in the tourism sector that are incorporating this technology to a greater extent are those related to the areas of marketing, logistics, and smart business models, according to the data extracted from the analysis. This technology already enables the application of solutions that predict and promote tourist behaviour based on sustainable behaviour and consumption habits, generating value for the different stakeholders.},

	abstract = {Tourism is a rapidly growing industry, even after seeing some drop back during the last few years due to COVID-19. The latest trend shows that it is gaining its position again to become a booming industry of the century, but as the industry gains pace, it faces several challenges that require modern solutions. With the coming up of new technologies, blockchain technology has gained rapid attention not only since it maintains a secure and decentralized record of transactions across the world but also due to its safe access to identifying data while enhancing accessibility for individuals in need in sectors like banking, travel, healthcare, and education. The current tourism industry fails the tourist by not providing a decentralized payment system for advance booking of hotels and vehicles, and the foreign tax required for such transactions increases the further cost for a tourist. With no real-time luggage tracking available, tourists are always on the lookout for their luggage. Blockchain technology improves the accuracy and reliability of baggage mishandling coding by providing a decentralized, tamper-proof record of all baggage handling events. If blockchain technology is incorporated into the tourism industry, many issues in the industry get solved, and it can grow more rapidly, helping economies all over the world by providing smart solutions to difficult problems and thus improving the experience of tourists by providing safety, a decentralized payment system, preventing fraud, and enhancing security by securing the data from unauthorized access. This research helps in further identifying the problem in the tourism industry and solving it by implementing blockchain technology, thus improving economies relying on the tourism industry.},

The tourism sector has an interest in blockchain technology due to its early and rapid adoption of technology. Today, blockchain technology is mainly used in finance. However, it is also preferred in tourism due to the opportunities it provides in data management, payment systems, identity management and loyalty programs. In this study, a literature review was first conducted to examine the use of blockchain technology in the tourism sector. Then, the first pioneer companies that emerged in the field of tourism were classified. The relationship between blockchain and tourism is evaluated within the scope of institutional analysis. Then, an analysis was carried out within the framework of the diffusion of innovation theory. As a result, it has been determined that blockchain technology is still developing. However, the promising and growing number of the first sectoral solutions increases the likelihood of acceptance. There is a lack of knowledge about blockchain among industry players and consumers. Integration of blockchain technology with tourism applications is ongoing, but no generally accepted standard has emerged. It has been determined that there are deficiencies regarding local and global legal regulations.},

	abstract = {How to keep customers motivated in participative behaviors remains one major challenge in extant loyalty program (LP) studies. While some companies have initiated efforts to utilize blockchain-based distributed ledgers and smart contract capabilities to enhance customer experience and improve LP efficiencies, academic assessment of blockchain application in the LP context remains scarce. This research attempts to establish a theoretical overview of how the key natures of blockchain influence customers’ varying motivations (economy, autonomy, competence and relatedness) and perceived value, which consequently induce participative behaviors in a loyalty points context. Then, using an exploratory case study of Bubichain in China, we verify that the blockchain-enabled loyalty points scheme not only improves customers’ economic perceived value by meeting their economic motives, as the traditional one does, but also enhances their social interaction and psychological self-fulfillment value perception by meeting their intrinsic motivations, thus increasing customers’ experience and participation behaviors.},

	abstract = {The rapid expansion of technical infrastructure has brought about transformative changes in business operations. A notable consequence of this digital evolution is the proliferation of subscription-based services. With an increasing array of options for goods and services, customer churn has emerged as a significant challenge, posing a threat to businesses across sectors. The direct impact on earnings has prompted businesses to proactively develop tools for predicting potential client turnover. Identifying the underlying factors contributing to churn is crucial for implementing effective retention strategies. Our research makes a pivotal contribution by presenting a churn prediction model designed to assist businesses in identifying clients at risk of churn. The proposed model leverages machine learning classification techniques, with the customer data undergoing thorough pre-processing phases prior to model application. We systematically evaluated ten classification techniques, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Kernel SVM, KNN, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, ADA Boost, XGBoost, and Gradient Boost. The assessment encompassed various evaluation metrics, such as ROC AUC Mean, ROC AUC STD, Accuracy Mean, Accuracy STD, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and F2 Score. Employing 10-fold cross-validation and hyper parameter tuning through GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV, we identified Random Forest as the most effective classifier, achieving an 85\% Area Under the Curve (AUC) for optimal results.},

	abstract = {Customer churn is a term used to describe customers leaving a company by no longer using their services or products. Companies should develop and target retention strategies towards customers at risk of churning, because customer acquisition is more costly than customer retention. At-risk customers can be identified using predictive machine learning. Previously, predictive churn modelling has typically been made for companies offering contractual products, where payments are made on a regular basis following a subscription or other contract. In these cases, the moment a customer churns is intuitively identified. Defining when a customer churns from a company offering non-contractual products, where the purchase occasions are sporadic, is more difficult, as the exact churn moment is both subjective and hard to identify. No studies of non-contractual customer churn have been made in the winter tourism industry, the industry in which non-contractual churn is defined and predicted in this thesis.},

	abstract = {Customer relationship management, or CRM (salesforce), refers to any business growth, customer retention, and customer strategies, methods, systems, and technologies that enhance customer interactions, encourage client retention, and boost a company's sales. The goal of the current research was to determine how CRM (Salesforce) software affected US economic growth, job creation, and revenue production in various industries. The information was gathered from previously released journal publications. According to the study's results, CRM (Salesforce) significantly improved the economies of firms employing it globally and in the US in particular. The results show that CRM (Salesforce) has a significant impact on the creation of jobs and the production of revenue in the US. CRM (Salesforce) resulted in the creation of 1486900 jobs in the US in 2020, 1728100 in 2021, 2024500 in 2022, 2271600 in 2023, 2495700 in 2024, and 2721300 in 2025. (2928700). According to similar data, CRM adoption in the United States will generate \$120.20 million in 2020. (salesforce). Through the usage of CRM, revenue of \$144.90 million was made in 2021, while revenue of \$173.10 million was generated in the US in 2022. (salesforce). According to the forecasted figures, the US would produce \$197.30 million in 2023, \$212.20 million in 2024, \$723.70 million in 2025, and \$279.50 million in 2026 via the usage of CRM (Salesforce). Additionally, this study found that Salesforce generates 78.7 billion dollars and 2.75 million jobs across a variety of industries, including 88.76 billion dollars and 1.1671 million jobs in whole sale, 154.2 billion dollars and 1.6073 million jobs in manufacturing, 13.1 billion dollars and 0.4802 million jobs in health and life sciences, 17.05 billion dollars and 0.6228 million jobs in government, 142.52 billion dollars and 1.6701 million jobs in finance, and 87.76 billion dollars and 1.0204 million jobs in finance. This research suggests that in order to enhance their survival rates and provide the most advantages, businesses in the domains of education, media, and the military must adopt CRM (Salesforce) for managing their operations.

A total of 600 travel agencies in South Africa participated in the study through the completion of an online survey. The data analysis technique used for the study was path analysis. The findings stipulate that travel agency owners and managers believe that providing differentiated products to their leisure customers, is the key to winning back lost customers and keeping existing customers. Travel agency owners and managers further indicated that this is an existing reintermediation strategy that they plan to practise in the future as well. It is therefore recommended that travel agents focus on delivering high-quality service to win back lost customers and thus reintermediate their businesses.},
